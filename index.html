            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Gerardo Cambronero, I am an Industrial Designer and User Experience (UX) consultant
            dedicated to the implementation of beautiful solutions to ill-design issues. My focus is to assist my
            clients through the design development process of new ideas and technologies, from initial concept to
            final prototype testing and project delivery. I have created work in fields such as consumer goods,
            trade show architecture, oil & gas, clean renewable energy, transportation design, futuristic habitat
            systems, and research and development of new and exciting technologies.
            <br><br>
            My design ideology emerges out of a careful analysis of how contemporary life constantly changes and
            the need for better infrastructure systems to sustain such demanding changes. I provide my clients with
            innovative, cost-effective, manufacturable, and marketable Industrial Design and User Experience
            solutions to provide fabrication-ready prototypes.
            <br><br>
            My design development is of the highest quality and I effectively manage all changes to projects
            without unduly affecting the stated objectives, benefits, and overall intent. I implement design
            research, visual conceptualization, Human-Factors, and Human-Centered Design principles to enhance the
            user experience of existing and emerging technologies. I also provide graphic design services by
            creating collateral art material, photography, and interface design for web applications and website
            design.
